- name: Silke Bauer
  role: Project coordinator / WP 5 leader
  image: assets/images/silke-bauer.jpg
  description: >
    Animal migrations, especially their large scale patterns and timing are Silke’s core research interest. Although much of her research has been devoted to migrants and migrations themselves, it increasingly also recognizes that migrants can have a multitude of effects and interact with the resident communities visited during their journeys. Silke is a researcher at the [Federal Research Institute (WSL)](https://www.wsl.ch).

  description: >
    Eva studies the ecological consequences of global land-use and climate change, with a particular focus on insects. On the one hand, she is interested in the large-scale spatio-temporal patterns and processes of those changes within and across ecosystems. On the other hand, on a smaller scale she studies the underlying mechanisms of the changes in an experimental way. Eva Knop is based at [Agroscope](https://agroscope.admin.ch/agroscope/en/home.html) and associated with the [University of Zürich](https://www.knoplab.ch).

  description: >
    Felix is an ecologist with broad interests, but a particular focus on bird migration. He has been fascinated for more than 30 years in using modern technology like radar and miniaturized data-loggers to investigate animal movements that are otherwise invisible. Felix led the Bird Migration Department at the Swiss Ornithological Institute, and has after retirement joined the private company [Swiss Birdradar Solutions AG](https://swiss-birdradar.com/). His focus has now extended to insect migration.

    Benjamin is an entomologist based at [Agroscope](https://agroscope.admin.ch/agroscope/en/home.html), where he uses small-scale radars to unravel the links between insect biomass, activity, and land use intensity. He earned his Ph.D. from the University of Würzburg, specializing in the ecology of honeybees, particularly those living in the wild. His current work at Agroscope is dedicated to understanding how environmental factors shape the diverse populations of insects, aiming to shed light on these vital yet often overlooked contributors to our ecosystems.
